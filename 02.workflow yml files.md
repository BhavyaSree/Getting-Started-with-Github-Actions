```yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
name: CI

# Controls when the action will run.
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
```

```yaml
on:
```
Controls when this action should run.  

For example
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
```
Here, our action will run whenever there is push event on the main branch.  
we can also filter the branches like main, branches,tags.

```yaml
Some possibilities

on:
  # push event
  push:
    branches:
      - master # only for the master branch
    tags:
      - v1  # only commits pushed to the v1 tag
    paths:
      - 'test/*' # only files that are in the test directory.
```
*or*

```yaml
workflow_dispatch:
```
Allows to run the workflow manually.

## Actions

Actions are the individual tasks we combine as steps to create a job.   
Actions are the smallest portable building block of the workflow. 

The workflows must have atleast one job.  
Job contains set of steps with actions or run commands or even API calls that will execute when the workflow is triggered.  

`runs-on` represents the runner. Runner is any machine with github actions runner application installed. 

Available github hosted runner types are  
* windows-latest or windows-2019
* ubuntu-latest or ubuntu-18.04
* ubuntu-16.04
* macos-latest or macos-10.15  

### self-hosted runner  

Self-hosted runners give us freedom, flexibility, and complete control over our GitHub Actions execution environment. These runners can be physical servers, virtual machines, or container images, and they can run on-premises, on a public cloud like Google Cloud, or on both using a platform like Anthos.

runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, ARM32] 

self-hosted - Run this job on a self-hosted runner.  
linux - Only use a Linux-based runner.  
ARM32 - Only use a runner based on ARM32 hardware.  

### Steps
Under steps, we have a standard actions that is being used.  

Checkout is a standard action that we must include on our workflow before that other actions, when workflow requires the copy of repository code.  

Checkout action checksout the repository under github workspace, so that workflow can access it.  
Not all steps run actions but all actions run as a step.  

run is to run the commands.  
To run multiple commands, we use | before giving the comamnds.

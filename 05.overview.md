### Actions

* Actions are your reusable units of code. 
* We can use action from the marketplace or create one or our own. 
* To use an action in a workflow run, you must include it as a step. 

### Artifacts

* Artifacts are the files created when we build and test our code.
* Binary, package or log files.

### CI-CD

* Create custom CI workflows that automate building and testing of our code.
* Create custom CD workflows to automatically deploy our code to any cloud, self-hosted service or platform from our repository. 

### Events

* Events are the specific activities that trigger a workflow run
* on:
* Provide a single event, an array of evens, or an array of event activity types.  

### Runners

* This tells our workflow run where the virtual environment will be.
* Wait for an available job to be kicked off when an event is triggered.
* Only run one job at a time.

### Jobs/Steps

* A job consits of one or more steps
* Jobs can run independently or sequentially
* A step is a set of tasks that can be executed by a job.

### Workflow File

* An automated process that is made up of one or multiple jobs and can be triggered by an event.
* Defined using a yaml file in .github/workflows directory.

## Workflow run

* Instance of our workflow that runs when the pre-configured event occurs.
* We can see the jobs, logs, and statys for each workflow run.

* CI will help us to stick to the quality standards by running tests and then reporting the results on GitHub. 
* CI tools run automated test builds triggered by commits pushed to the project on Github.
* Results are post back to Github with pull requests. So that it will be easy for the contributors to check the status of CI checks.
* This reduces the context switching and errors.
* This also improves consistency for testing.  
* This makes fewer bugs in the production and shorter feedback cycles of the development.

With Github Actions, we have the ability to integrate CI with CD and real time streaming logs built right into the Github repository.

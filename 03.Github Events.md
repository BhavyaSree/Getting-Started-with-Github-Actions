### Github Webhook events

We can configure our workflow to run when webhook events are created on GitHub.  

on: [push, pull_request]  

#### Activity types of pull_request

- assigned
- unassigned
- review_requested
- review_request_removed
- labeled
- unlabeled
- opened
- edited
- closed
- ready_for_review
- locked
- unlocked
- reopened

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
     types: [assigned, unassigned]
```

```yaml
on:
  issue_comment:
      types: [created, deleted]
```

### Schedule events

We can schedule a workflow to run at specific UTC times using POSIX cron syntax.

Shortest interval that we can scheduled workflow is once every 5 minutes.

Schedule for 15 minutes
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/15 * * * *'
```

### Repository_dispatch events

These are the events that are happened out of Github.  

To trigger the custom repository dispatch webhook events, we need to send a POST request to the GitHub API endpoint.  

We also need to include repository_dispatch with identified types in the workflow file.  

```yaml
on: repository_dispatch
  types: [opened, deleted]  
```
